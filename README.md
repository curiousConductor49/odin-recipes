# odin-recipes
This project is a simple single-page recipe site that covers important concepts explained in The Odin Project's HTML and CSS Fundamentals sections.
The recipe website will demonstrate basic HTML skills such as headings, paragraphs, anchors, lists, etc. It will also employ basic but crucial CSS concepts like the box model.
